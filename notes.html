system.out.printf()
            -prints on the same line
	    -placeholders: %s (string) %d(int) %f(floting point number)
	    -%n_s/d/f leaves n number of spaces for each string/int/float



  mergesort(a.k.a. the stuyvesant way)
         -sorts recursively
	 -breaks apart the given set to sort and then merge



  <b>merge sort:2nlogN (aka nlogN)</b>
  - splits/levels logBASE2(1)
  - each split loops thru array: n
  - each levels of merge: n
  linear search: n
  binary search: logN

Big O notation (order notation)
   function f(n) is said to be O(g(n)) [order g(n) or Big O g(n) ]
   if there exists some constant k such that K(g(n))> f(n) and the 
   long term.
